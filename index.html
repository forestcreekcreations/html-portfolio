    <p>
      I'm a hands-on problem solver with over 20 years of real-world experience
      across industries-construction, oilfield, hospitality, sales, and now
      digital design. I've worn a lot of hats over the years: from running a
      restaurant shift solo at 15 while homeschooling, to managing renovation
      sites, selling funeral pre-planning services, and spending long days on
      drilling rigs. Every one of those roles has sharpened my instincts for
      hard work, communication, and adapting on the fly.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Today, I'm channeling that same grit and independence into building
      websites and digital tools-especially for local tradespeople and small
      business owners who want something solid and authentic online. I know what
      it means to work with your hands, talk straight, and deliver real value,
      because I've lived it.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Whether I'm designing a clean, mobile-friendly site or helping someone
      rebrand their business, I bring the same work ethic and creative energy
      I've carried through every job I've ever done.
