<h1>The Best Movies According to Dan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Donnie Darko</h3>
<p>This movie has so many good elements that make you think, and it really messes with your senses.
    <br /> Plus I love Frank.
</p>
<h3>Deadpool</h3>
<p>Deadpool has always been my favourite character, and the fact that they made 3 movies for him just tickles me.</p>
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>Fight Club has always held a special place in my heart.  I love the interactions between Brad Pitt and Ed Norton, they play well off of each other, and the chemistry between them and Helena Bonham Carter is fantastic.</p>
